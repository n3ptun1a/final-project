Dear next class, or cohort

Please, apply yourself. Throughout this semester, I have put myself through the loop of having dreams not so far out of reach, but this inexplicable fear of not knowing where to start. But, I beg of you, start. It is incredible what you can do once the first couple of lines of code are just down, even if not functional. It within the first few defined classes or variables that ideas can begin to sprout and flourish, and allow your dream program to come to life. In that regard, don't be afraid to reach out for help. I understand there is a certain satisfaction in completing an assignment on your own, but it is important that if you are ever stuck or feel misplaced in your programming journey, to reach out for help. This is something I did scarcely throughout the semester, and with the infinite opportunities to attend office hours, or simple email Lady K, I instead settled for perseverance. This sealed my fate in ways I can't describe. What you are reading right now is coming from a student who is handing in their final late; DONT BE LIKE ME. Had I reached out sooner, I could have fully developed what felt like me to be a passion project, but within my solitude, I sold myself short. As long as you're reaching out, even if not for the answers to your questions but for advice alone, I promise the informaion you gain from those interactions is best described as invaluable. Allow yourself to benefit from the fruits of knowledge passed down from not only Lady K, but her mentors and inspirations, and her students, and your peers, and so so much more. Information is all around, it is up to you to gather it and propel yourself with its blessings.

Best regards,
Daniel
