You are playing

**GOLF**

It's simple enough, resembles GamePigeon golf on iMessage, and the objective is simple:

Get the yellow circle (golf ball ) into the black circle (hole)

Click on the ball to initiate your putt. 
Drag backwards from where you want to shoot, like charging up a putt.
Release to shoot.

Note:
There is wind at each hole, and you must play in accordance to it
There are wells that will attempt to suck in and alter the path of your ball; avoid them.
There is a friction mechanic which slows the ball down gradually after each putt.

Levels:
Level 1: features a bluer scene with dainty wells, these are not as strong as the wells on:
Level 2: Larger, stronger wells, as well as a stronger wind, basically an upgrade.

Your high score is stored locally, so should you choose to replay the game, your high score will be preserved upon replay!
